# .windsurf Directory

This directory stores planning artefacts for the **Windsurf (Cascade) workflow**.

- `tasks/` â€” individual task plans. Each file follows the template in `WINDSURF.md` and is named `<TASK-NAME>.md`.
- Future sub-folders (e.g., `research/`, `decisions/`) can be added as the project evolves.

> ðŸ“Œ  **Rule:** No implementation code should be added here. Only planning and documentation files live in `.windsurf/`.
