# Custom ID Feature Implementation Audit Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive analysis of the current custom ID feature implementation state to identify completed work, missing pieces, code quality issues, and create a roadmap for completion.

## Audit Objectives

### 1. Implementation Completeness Assessment
- **Files Analysis**: Scan all files in `src/features/builder/` and related directories
- **Component Coverage**: Identify which components have custom ID support
- **Feature Status**: Determine what's working vs broken
- **Missing Pieces**: List unimplemented parts of the feature

### 2. Data Flow Analysis
- **Unlayer Integration**: How selection events flow from Unlayer
- **Store Management**: State updates and data persistence
- **UI Updates**: Panel synchronization with selected elements
- **Event Chain**: Complete event flow documentation
- **Breakpoint Identification**: Where the data flow fails

### 3. Code Quality Review
- **Debugging Code**: Console logs, temporary implementations
- **Performance Issues**: O(nÂ³) loops and inefficient patterns
- **Unused Code**: Dead code and incomplete implementations
- **Pattern Consistency**: Adherence to project patterns
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript usage and type definitions

### 4. Integration Problems
- **Unlayer Events**: Event listener setup and reliability
- **Store State**: State management inconsistencies
- **Component Selection**: Detection mechanism failures
- **Data Structure**: Mismatches between expected and actual data

### 5. Architecture Assessment
- **Design Patterns**: Current architecture evaluation
- **Scalability**: Future extensibility considerations
- **Refactoring Needs**: Areas requiring restructuring
- **Best Practices**: Alignment with project standards

## Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: File Discovery (30 mins)
1. Scan project structure for custom ID related files
2. Identify all modified files related to the feature  
3. Map file relationships and dependencies
4. Create file inventory with purpose documentation

### Phase 2: Implementation Analysis (45 mins)
1. Examine each component's custom ID implementation
2. Test working vs broken functionality
3. Document current feature capabilities
4. Identify incomplete implementations

### Phase 3: Data Flow Tracing (30 mins)
1. Follow selection events from Unlayer
2. Track store state changes
3. Monitor UI panel updates
4. Document event chain and identify breaks

### Phase 4: Code Quality Assessment (30 mins)
1. Scan for debugging code and console logs
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Find unused imports and dead code
4. Check TypeScript usage and type safety

### Phase 5: Architecture Review (30 mins)
1. Evaluate current design decisions
2. Identify architectural problems
3. Assess maintainability and extensibility
4. Document refactoring requirements

### Phase 6: Documentation & Recommendations (45 mins)
1. Compile comprehensive audit report
2. Prioritize issues by severity and impact
3. Create step-by-step fix plan
4. Provide architectural recommendations

## Expected Deliverables
